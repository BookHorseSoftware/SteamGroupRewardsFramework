> A super-simple framework for granting users rewards for joining your Steam group.

SteamGroupRewardsFramework is a dead-simple, FOSS framework for granting users on your Garry's Mod server rewards for joining your Steam group. It allows for recurring or one-time rewards, and is as simple as writing callback functions. It couldn't get easier and more powerful.

## Install

Simply clone a version of this addon to your server's addon directory. There are no external dependencies.

**NOTE:** On Linux hosts, Garry's Mod does not take into account capital letters in file paths. You will likely need to _rename_ the folder you cloned to all lowercase to avoid this.

## Configuration

General configuration may be found under the **GENERAL SETTINGS** header in `lua/sgrf/config.lua`. The configuration options are documented below:

- `SGRF.Config.Commands`

  An array of possible chat commands to open the Steam group page. Note that these chat commands **also** check to see if the user has joined the Steam group upon re-entering the game, so it is best to remove any Steam group commands from other addons if possible. Set to an empty array to disable the command.
  
- `SGRF.Config.SteamGroup`

  The group ID to check for player membership. It's the numbers (YYYYYY) in http://steamcommunity.com/gid/YYYYYY. This number can also be found in your group's "edit profile" section.

- `SGRF.Config.SteamAPIKey`

  This is a Steam Community API key. You can find it at http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.

## Usage

### Adding new rewards

To add new rewards, edit `lua/sgrf/config.lua`. Under the **REWARDS SETTINGS** header, and under `SGRF.Rewards = {}`, add your custom rewards. Use the following format:

```lua
SGRF.Rewards.Name = {
	OneTime  = false,
	Callback = function(ply)
		-- Your code goes here!
	end,
}
```

**Structure:** (all elements are **required**)

- `Name`

  The name to give this reward. Used internally in logging messages, but is still required. To use characters not supported by Lua's `.` syntax, replace the period with square brackets `[]` and add your name between quotes (`''` or `""`) inside them.
  
- `OneTime`

  Designates whether or not this reward is only redeemable once (ie, if the user leaves and rejoins the group, they will not receive this reward again). Set this to `true` to enable this feature, or leave it as `false` to grant the reward every time they join.

- `Callback`

  The callback to run to handle this reward. Takes `ply` as a parameter, which is the player currently being rewarded.

### Rewards outside of callbacks

This addon also makes use of PData. To grant rewards outside of those available in callbacks, _eg_ PAC3 access or hook-related rewards, use the helper function `SGRF.IsPlayerInGroup(ply)` documented in [API](#api).

Alternatively, you may use the PData variable `SGRF_InSteamGroup`. **NOTE**, however, that `Player:GetPData` (annoyingly) returns `string`s, so you will have to check if the returned value equals the **STRING** `'true'` if the player is in the group or the **STRING** `'false'` if the player is **not** in the group.

## API

### Global functions

- `SGRF.RewardPlayer(ply)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Manually rechecks a player and rewards them accordingly. This is called on spawn, or when a player returns from using the configured Steam group commands.
  
  - `ply` - The player to check and reward (if applicable)
  
- `SGRF.CheckPlayer(ply, callback)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Manually rechecks a player's group membership status. The bulk of the processing goes on here.
  
  We recommend using the PData variable mentioned in [Rewards outside of callbacks](#rewards-outside-of-callbacks) if you want to implement your own rewards that can't be handled by callbacks. However, if you find a use for this function, go right ahead and use it.
  
  - `ply` - The player to check
  - `callback` - The callback to run once operations are complete
    - `ply` - The player object from earlier, for convenience

- `SGRF.IsPlayerInGroup(ply)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Checks the given player's Steam group status with PData.

  Does not poll any external APIs, just checks the data we've already pulled. Helper function to work around PData's annoying use of strings.

  - `ply` - The player to check

- `SGRF.HasPlayerExhaustedReward(ply, reward)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Checks if the given player has exhausted the given one-time reward.

  - `ply` - The player to check
  - `reward` - The name of the reward to look for

- `SGRF.Log(channel, _str, ...)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Writes a log message to the server console prefixed with the given channel. Uses `string.format` internally.
  
  - `channel` - The channel to write to
  - `_str` - The string to write (may use `string.format`-style format strings)
  - `...` - Additional arguments for `string.format`
  
- `SGRF.ColoredChatPrint(ply, ...)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Writes a prefixed, colored chat message to a given player's chat. Uses `chat.AddText` internally.
  
  - `ply` - The player to write the chat message to
  - `...` - A set of `Color`s and `string`s to pass to `chat.AddText`

- `SGRF.ColoredChatBroadcast(...)` - **SERVERSIDE**

  Writes a prefixed, colored chat message to every player on the server's chat. Uses `chat.AddText` internally.
  
  - `...` - A set of `Color`s and `string`s to pass to `chat.AddText`
