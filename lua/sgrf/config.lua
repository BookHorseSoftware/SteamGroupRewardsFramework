Add your custom rewards here!

SGRF.Rewards = SGRF.Rewards or {} -- DO NOT TOUCH ME

-- Add your custom rewards here!
-- To grant rewards outside of those available in callbacks, eg PAC3 access or hook-related rewards,
-- use the helper function SGRF.IsPlayerInGroup(ply) documented below.
-- Alternatively, you may use the PData variable SGRF_InSteamGroup. NOTE, however, that Player:GetPData
-- (annoyingly) returns strings, so you will have to check if the returned value equals the STRING 'true'
-- if the player is in the group or the STRING 'false' if the player is not in the group.

-- TO ADD NEW REWARDS, use the template below.
